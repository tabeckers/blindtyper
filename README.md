# BlindTyper
This program can be used to practise blind typing.

It consists of a WPF xaml visual interface with a C# backend. The user can select a .txt file in which each line contains a sentence. The user has to type out every sentence. The text is highlighted in different colors in order to indicate the users progress regarding a sentence. Incorrect characters are recorded and an accuracy percentage is shown at the end of completing all sentences present within the .txt file.

What I learned from this project:
- How to combine WPF with C#
- How to properly use xaml resources
- How to properly use .resx resources
- How to apply different textcolors within a single TextElement
